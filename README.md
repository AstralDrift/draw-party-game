No apps, no downloads, no accounts. Pure web-based fun that works on any device.

## ✨ What Makes This Special

## 🎮 How to Play

### The "Drawful" Twist
This isn't just Pictionary! It's a two-phase guessing game:

1. **Everyone draws** their own unique prompt (60 seconds)
2. **One drawing is shown** → everyone guesses what it could be
3. **All guesses displayed** → vote for the real answer
4. **Points for everything** - correct guesses, tricking others, getting your art guessed

### Scoring System
- **Artist**: 100 points per person who guesses your drawing correctly
- **Correct Guesser**: 200 points for voting for the real answer  
- **Trickster**: 50 points per person who votes for your fake answer

*Bad drawings + clever fake answers = hilarious results!*
