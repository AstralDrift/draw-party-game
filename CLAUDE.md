# Draw Party - Claude Code Context & Development Guide

## üìã Project Overview

**Draw Party** is a multiplayer online drawing game designed for party gameplay. The core concept is simple: players take turns drawing prompts while others guess what they're drawing, followed by voting to determine the correct answer.

### üéØ Core Design Principles
- **30-Second Rule**: Any feature must be explainable in 30 seconds or less
- **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)**: Simple to learn, hard to put down
- **Party-First**: Every decision optimized for group fun and social interaction
- **Zero Learning Curve**: Grandma should be able to join and play immediately

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### Single-File Application
- **Primary File**: `index.html` (~2000+ lines)
- **Architecture**: Everything embedded (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- **Rationale**: Ultra-portable, no build process, works anywhere

### Key Technologies
- **Frontend**: HTML5 Canvas, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript ES6+
- **Networking**: PeerJS for WebRTC P2P connections
- **PWA**: Service Worker (`sw.js`), Web App Manifest (`manifest.json`)
- **Deployment**: GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel compatible

### Core Game Components
- **DrawingHistory Class**: Undo/redo functionality with 20-step buffer
- **DrawPartyGame Class**: Main game controller with state management
- **Timer System**: Phase-based countdown timers (90s/45s/30s)
- **Performance Optimizations**: 60fps drawing, throttled networking, device testing

## üéÆ Game Flow (Completed)

### Phase 1: Drawing
- Each player draws their assigned prompt simultaneously
- Only the artist can see their prompt and draw
- Real-time performance optimization with drawing buffers

### Phase 2: Guessing
- Players view each drawing and submit text guesses
- Input validation and automatic submission checking

### Phase 3: Voting
- Multiple choice voting (correct answer + player guesses + decoys)
- Visual feedback and automatic advancement

### Phase 4: Results
- Score calculation with celebration animations
- Artist points based on correct vote percentage
- Voter points for selecting correct answers

## üîß Gemini CLI Integration

### When to Use Gemini CLI
Claude Code has permission to use the Gemini CLI in non-interactive mode for large codebase analysis:

```bash
gemini -p "Your analysis prompt here"
```

### Use Cases for Gemini
1. **Large Codebase Analysis**: When you need to understand relationships across the entire 2000+ line codebase
2. **Performance Optimization**: Analyzing the complete drawing pipeline and networking code
3. **Bug Investigation**: When issues span multiple interconnected systems
4. **Architecture Review**: Understanding the complete game state management flow

### Effective Gemini Prompts
```bash
# Analyze complete game flow
gemini -p "Analyze the complete game loop in this Draw Party codebase. Focus on the phase transitions from drawing ‚Üí guessing ‚Üí voting ‚Üí results. Identify any potential race conditions or state management issues."

# Performance analysis
gemini -p "Review the canvas drawing performance optimizations in this game. Look for bottlenecks in the drawing buffer system, animation loops, and network broadcasting. Suggest improvements for 60fps on mobile."

# Network architecture review
gemini -p "Examine the PeerJS networking implementation. Focus on connection stability, message handling, host migration, and error recovery. Identify potential failure points in party game scenarios."
```

### When NOT to Use Gemini
- **Simple File Reading**: Use Read tool for specific files
- **Small Code Changes**: Use Edit/MultiEdit for targeted modifications
- **Testing/Execution**: Gemini can't run code or test functionality

## üì± Performance Considerations

### Mobile-First Approach
- **Device Testing**: Automatic performance testing and setting adjustment
- **Touch Optimization**: Passive event listeners, cached rectangle calculations
- **Battery Efficiency**: Capped device pixel ratio, optimized animation loops
- **Network Efficiency**: Throttled broadcasts (50ms intervals), compressed data

### Key Performance Metrics
- **Target**: 60fps drawing on 3+ year old mobile devices
- **Network Latency**: <100ms for drawing updates between players
- **Load Time**: <2 seconds initial game load
- **Memory**: <50MB during typical gameplay sessions

## üéØ Current Priorities (GitHub Issues)

### Completed ‚úÖ
- **Core Game Loop Perfection** (#21): Complete Draw‚ÜíGuess‚ÜíVote‚ÜíResults flow

### Next Critical Issues
1. **üåê Rock-Solid Networking** (#18): Handle real-world party scenarios (poor WiFi, player dropouts)
2. **‚ö° Core Performance Optimization** (#17): Ensure 60fps across all devices
3. **üîß Production Ready & Reliable** (#20): Zero crashes, graceful error handling

### Important but Secondary
- **üñåÔ∏è Simple Drawing Tools Polish** (#2): Basic tool improvements only
- **üì± Instant Access & Sharing** (#19): Frictionless joining experience
- **üé≤ Large Group Support** (#16): Handle 8-20+ players

## üö´ Explicitly Avoided Complexity

Based on KISS principles, these features were **intentionally removed** or **simplified**:

### Removed Features
- Advanced drawing tools (shapes, layers, complex brushes)
- Achievement/progression systems
- Analytics dashboards
- Complex game modes
- Internationalization (beyond basic accessibility)
- Marketing automation

### Simplified Features
- **Accessibility**: Basic keyboard nav and screen reader support only
- **UI/UX**: Clean polish without complex design systems
- **Documentation**: Minimal, focused on essential context only

## üé™ Party Game Focus

### Success Metrics
- **Viral Coefficient**: How often players share with friends
- **Session Length**: 30-60 minutes without feeling long
- **Replay Desire**: 90%+ want to play "one more round"
- **Accessibility**: Anyone can join and start playing within 15 seconds

### Real-World Testing Priorities
1. **House Party WiFi**: Overloaded home networks
2. **Mixed Devices**: iOS/Android/desktop in same game
3. **Phone Interruptions**: Handle calls, app switching seamlessly
4. **Large Groups**: 8-20 players without performance degradation

## üí° Development Tips

### Code Style
- **No comments unless essential**: Code should be self-documenting
- **Performance over elegance**: Party games must be responsive
- **Error recovery over prevention**: Graceful degradation for network issues
- **Mobile-first**: Always test touch interactions first

### Testing Strategy
- **Real Device Testing**: Use actual phones/tablets, not browser dev tools
- **Network Stress Testing**: Test on slow/unstable connections
- **Party Simulation**: Test with multiple real players simultaneously
- **Duration Testing**: Long sessions (2+ hours) for memory leaks

This context should help maintain the project's focus on creating a simple, addictive party game that prioritizes fun over complexity.
